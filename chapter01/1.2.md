Section 1.2 of the textbook, "Objects in Python," explains the core of Python’s object-oriented model, covering how data is represented, assigned, and structured using built-in classes.

### **1.2.1 Identifiers, Objects, and the Assignment Statement**

* 
**The Assignment Statement**: Commands like `temperature = 98.6` establish an **identifier** (or name) and associate it with an **object** in memory.


* **Identifiers**:
* They are **case-sensitive** (e.g., `temperature` and `Temperature` are distinct).


* They can contain letters, numerals, and underscores but **cannot begin with a numeral**.


* There are **33 reserved words** (like `False`, `def`, `if`) that cannot be used as identifiers.




* 
**Dynamic Typing**: Unlike Java or C++, Python is **dynamically typed**; an identifier is not tied to a specific data type and can be reassigned to objects of different types at any time.


* 
**Aliasing**: A programmer can create an alias by assigning a second identifier to an existing object. Changes made to a mutable object through one alias will be visible through the other.


* 
**Object Identity**: Each identifier is associated with the memory address of the object it refers to. Reassigning an identifier to a new value (e.g., `x = x + 5`) creates a new object and breaks the old alias.



### **1.2.2 Creating and Using Objects**

* 
**Instantiation**: The process of creating a new instance of a class, typically by invoking its **constructor** (e.g., `w = Widget()`).


* 
**Literal Forms**: Many built-in classes can be instantiated using literals rather than explicit constructors (e.g., `98.6` for a `float` or `[1, 2, 3]` for a `list`).


* 
**Calling Methods**: Methods are member functions invoked on a specific instance using the dot operator (e.g., `data.sort()`).


* 
**Accessors**: Methods that return information about an object's state without changing it.


* 
**Mutators (Update Methods)**: Methods that change the state of an object.





### **1.2.3 Python's Built-In Classes**

Python distinguishes between **immutable** classes (value cannot change after creation) and **mutable** classes.

| Class | Description | Mutability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **`bool`** | Logical values: `True` or `False`.

 | Immutable 

 |
| **`int`** | Integers with **arbitrary magnitude**.

 | Immutable 

 |
| **`float`** | Floating-point numbers (fixed-precision, similar to "double" in other languages).

 | Immutable 

 |
| **`list`** | A **mutable** sequence of arbitrary objects.

 | Mutable 

 |
| **`tuple`** | An **immutable** version of a list.

 | Immutable 

 |
| **`str`** | An **immutable** sequence of text characters (Unicode).

 | Immutable 

 |
| **`set`** | Unordered collection of distinct, immutable objects.

 | Mutable 

 |
| **`frozenset`** | Immutable version of the `set` class.

 | Immutable 

 |
| **`dict`** | Associative mapping of unique keys to values.

 | Mutable 

 |

#### **Key Class Details**

* 
**`int` and `float**`: Python automatically manages integer precision based on magnitude. The `int()` and `float()` constructors can be used to convert other types or parse strings.


* **Sequence Types (`list`, `tuple`, `str`)**:
* 
**`list`**: Stores references to objects (referential structure) and is zero-indexed ( to ).


* **`tuple`**: Delimited by parentheses `()`. A single-element tuple requires a trailing comma, e.g., `(17,)`.


* **`str`**: Specially optimized for characters; Python has no separate "char" class (characters are strings of length 1).




* **`set` and `dict**`:
* 
**`set`**: Uses a **hash table** for highly optimized containment checks (`in` operator). Only immutable types can be elements of a set.


* 
**`dict`**: Also based on hash tables, mapping unique keys to associated values. `M[k]` is used to access the value associated with key `k`.
